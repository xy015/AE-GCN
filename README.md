## Introduction
In medical scenarios, image classification using heterogeneous feature poses a significant challenge. This is especially pertinent in lung cancer diagnosis, where accurately distinguishing between pre-invasive lung adenocarcinoma (Pre-IAs) and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAs), as well as classifying the subtypes of IAs, is crucial.

To enhance accurate prediction, we utilized a combination of deep learning and radiomics features, each extracted via distince methodologies from computed tomography images. Specifically, we integrated these heterogeneous features using an adaptive fusion module that can learn attention-based discriminative features.

The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated using real-world data collected from a multi-center cohort.
