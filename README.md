## Introduction
In medical scenarios, identifying high-risk factors in early-stage lung cancers is vital for surgical planning. Currently, surgeons rely on intraoperative pathological analyses for decision-making. However,preoperative determination, such as using CT images, remains a significant challenge. 

In this paper, we introduce the AE-GCN model, a novel approach combining attentional features with spatial information to tackle this challenge. We develop a novel graph construction method integrating nodule positionalinformation with GCN, enabling more efficient and faster model training. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms many of the previous benchmarks. The AE-GCN model enables thoracic surgeons to assess the high-risk probability of pulmonary nodules using only CT images,aiding in preoperative surgical planning.

The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated using real-world data collected from a multi-center cohort.
